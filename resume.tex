% OBJECTIVE - WHAT I WANT FROM THE POSITION
%------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{My Objective}
  I am seeking employment within a company where I may succeed in a stimulating
  and challenging environment, building the success of the company whilst being
  given the opportunity to expand upon the skills and knowledge I have acquired
  in my career thus far.
\end{rSection}

%----------------------------------
% PERSONAL STATEMENT - ALL ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Personal Statement}
  I am currently an employee at Your Golf Travel primarily developing internal
  systems and infrastructure.

  I have a strong programming skill set with particular attention to Go and
  Ruby; focussing on microservices and Ruby on Rails frontends each for the
  last 4 years. However I have commercial experience with mobile application
  development in Objective-C, Swift and Kotlin.

  Furthermore I am a strong advocate of the DevOps movement with a great
  interest in improved communication across disaplines. I believe that DevOps
  should not be defined in terms of tools but instead as a cultural shift.

  Given my past experiences, curiosity to try new technologies, and my passion
  for \href{https://github.com/tomasbasham?tab=repositories}{open source}
  software projects I know I am able to bring a great deal of knowledge and
  experience to a role in the technology industry.
